            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>Our first goal is to serve our customers very quickly, with great hygiene as well. However, we can't have our quality in food drop, which is why we all here at The Wafrican Dream promise to serve you customers quickly, and always serve with delectable, hot food, with portions that won't disappoint. We will also provide great customer service with a bubbly atmosphere in all of our locations worldwide. Our final goal is to be a food fusion restaurant that entertains traditional African food but also more Western food.</p>

We will look at 3 types of loops


1. For loop: The while loop is a kind loop that runs while the condition is true. The structure of the while loop can be seen below

for (initialized variable, condition, incremental){
    //body of the loop
}

for (i =1; i <= 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
} // 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10;

2. While loop: this kind of loop executes only when the condition is true. The syntax can be seen below

initialized variable;

while (condition){
    //body of the loop
    //incremental
}

let i = 1;

while (i <= 10) {
    console.log(i)
    i++;
}



3. Do While loop: This kind of loop checks for a condition only after running at least once. The syntax can be seen below.

initialized variable;

do {
    //body of the loop

    //incremental
}while(condition)


let i = 1;

do {
    console.log(i);
    i++
} while( i <= 10);

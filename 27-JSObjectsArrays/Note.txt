An Object is a collection key-value pairs which are called properties that allows us store more than one piece of data about something. objects are typically used to model real world entities. Objects are created using the object literal {}.

You can create an empty object like so, let myObj = {}; After which you can the add properties

myObj.name = "My Object";


You can create an object with properties from scratch, for example,

let myObj2 = {
    name: "This is my name"
    id: 1,
}

myObj2.newProp = "New Property"


To delete a property 

delete myObj.newProp;


Arrays

An array is a collection of ordered items. As opposed to objects that its contents can be accessed using property names, array elements (items inside the array which are separated by a comma) are accessed using index. Arrays are created using square brackets.

let myArr = []

Index is a memory location in an array, the first index in an array is 0.

Length: this is the total number of elements in an array.
